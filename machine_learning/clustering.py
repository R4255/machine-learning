#clustering is an unsupervised form of learning
#we assign each point to a nearest centroid 
#we find the center of mass of all the data points and 
#put the centroid to that location
#reassign every point once again to the closest centroid
#we repeat the above 3 steps until no point changes which centroid it belongs to

#markov models we deal with probability distributions
#example to predict the weather forecast given the probability of the different event
#hidden markov model is a finit set of states each of which is associated with a probabilitiy distribution
#we actually dont care about the states we care about the observations from each state
